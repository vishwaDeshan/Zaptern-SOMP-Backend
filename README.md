# Clean Architecture
Clean Architecture is a software design pattern focused on creating a modular and maintainable codebase by clearly separating concerns and managing dependencies. It achieves this by organizing code into multiple layers, each with distinct responsibilities, and enforcing strict boundaries between them. Below, Iâ€™ll outline the key principles of Clean Architecture and provide an example of a .NET 7 code structure that adheres to these principles.

# Key Principles of Clean Architecture:
Separation of Concerns: The codebase is divided into distinct layers, each responsible for specific aspects of the application.
Dependency Rule: Dependencies flow inward, meaning that outer layers rely on inner layers, but not vice versa. This ensures that components can be easily replaced or modified.
Abstraction over Implementation: Interfaces and abstractions are used to define contracts, allowing high-level modules to be decoupled from low-level details.
Testability: The architecture is designed to facilitate unit testing by allowing isolated testing of components at different levels.
Independence of Frameworks: The core business logic is not tied to any specific framework or library, making it more portable and easier to maintain.

# Presentation Layer (Web/API):
The Presentation Layer manages user interactions by handling HTTP requests and responses. It depends on the Application Layer for processing and data management. This layer includes controllers, view models, and UI components, serving as the interface between the user and the application.

# Application Layer:
The Application Layer contains application-specific business logic and coordinates between the Presentation and Domain Layers. It handles use cases, application services, and data mapping, depending on the Domain Layer for core logic while abstracting away data access and infrastructure concerns.

# Domain Layer:
The Domain Layer holds the core business logic of the application. It focuses on domain models, entities, and services, remaining independent of other layers. This isolation ensures that the core functionality is unaffected by changes in user interfaces or external dependencies.

# Infrastructure Layer:
The Infrastructure Layer provides implementations for external dependencies such as databases and third-party services. It relies on the Domain and Application Layers and includes data access components and service clients. This layer manages external interactions while keeping the business logic separate.
